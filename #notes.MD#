* Trouw

* Combination of the newspapers



* 17th Century Newspapers


## Methods


Use method by Carlos for calculating convergence of w2v models. 
Removed the word checking in dictionary.

Check with data removal of short articles and long articles. Compare convergence rates

Use existing model (Dutch embeddings) add new data and see what happens. Do vectors
change? Is this a sign of specific discourse

Compare two newspapers




## TODO 

Determine datasets



Run preprocessing

- Run with cleaning of newspapers and not cleaning
- Alignment of vectors
- Talk about possible uses
